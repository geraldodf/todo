This project is an example of a web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase, focused on demonstrating design patterns and architectures, such as Hexagonal Architecture, Use Cases, Value Objects, and Facade. The main goal is to illustrate the practical application of these patterns and Clean Code and Clean Architecture concepts in a web development context.
